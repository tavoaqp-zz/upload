  <comment>Java Multiple File Upload Applet (JUpload) takes care of
		the limitation posed by traditional HTML upload forms
		by allowing you to upload a whole directory and the files within it with
		a single click. Optionally, it allows
		simple picture management. JUpload works also as a standard standalone Java application,
		and can be embedded in any Java application to do HTTP or FTP file transfert.</comment>
